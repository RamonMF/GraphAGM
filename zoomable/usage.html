<h3><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">1. Introduction</font></h3>

<p>Works are classified into three categories: <strong>Content</strong>,
<strong>Genre</strong> and <strong>Style</strong> and every category is
represented as a ring in the sunburst. <strong>Authors</strong> and
<strong>works</strong> are also represented by its own ring (black and grey
respectively). A ring consists of arcs representing the percentage of words
classified in that category, author or work. Categories and values can be
distinguished by its colours. Look at the "Legend" to consult the
colour-value correspondence.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Moving the mouse over the graph makes the hovered arcs of the graph
visible.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>And a breadcrumb with the names of the selected category-value sequence is
showed. </p>

<p></p>

<p>At the same time, at the bottom-right part of the graph the percentage of
words and chars in the current sequence is shown.</p>

<p><img src="images/percentages2.png" name="Sunburst" width="380" height="200"
border="0"></p>

<p>The first two percentages are in relation to the total works in the database
and the second two are in relation to the currently selected works.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">2. Filters</font></h3>

<p>Some dates or data of the works contained in the database are not exact.
With the blue buttons at the right part of the screen we can filter by
exact/inexact data/dates. If any button is pressed it turns gray and
automatically all works of the corresponding criteria are excluded and the
sunburst is updated. If all buttons are grey simultaneosly then no graph will
be shown because all works will be excluded.</p>

</p>

<p></p>

<h3><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span lang="en-US">3. Zooming</span></font></h3>

<p>Clicking on any arc of the graph zooms in and turns the selected arc into
the new root (center) of the sunburst. This is very useful to study smaller
sections of the graph in detail.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><img src="images/zoomed.png" name="Sunburst" width="700" height="450"

<p></p>

<p>In the example above we have zoomed-in into astronomical-treatise-canonical
works. The detail view shows the six authors and their corresponding works and
relative percentages. </p>

<p></p>

<h3><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">4. Reordering categories</font></h3>

<p align="left">The default order of the categories, authors and works can be
changed using the ordering buttons between the legend and the data/date
buttons. The first button corresponds to the center of the graph and so on.</p>

<p>Clicking on one of this buttons makes it change its position with the
category that is one place upwards. </p>

<p>In four words: CLICK TO MOVE UP.</p>

border="0"><img src="images/order_chk.png" name="Sunburst" width="120"
height="210" border="0"></p>

<p></p>

<p>If the selected category is already at the first place then its position is
changed with the last one of the list. </p>

<p><img src="images/order_chk.png" name="Sunburst" width="120"
height="210" border="0"><img src="images/order_overflow.png" name="Sunburst" width="180"
height="240" border="0"></p>

<p>The graph is updated automatically with every change.</p>
